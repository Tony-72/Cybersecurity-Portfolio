# Hello, I'm Anthony (Tony) Hasty Jr.
<a href="www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-hasty-jr-bb663679" /></a>


I am a proffesional Avionics/Systems Test Technican and Cybersecurity enthusiast aspiring to land my first Cybersecurity SOC Analyst job. I enjoy being innovative and using creative critical thinking to find, analyse, and address, constantly evolving cybersecurity threats. I am CompTIA Security+CE certified with security clearance and recently completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. 

I am currently enrolled in the Google IT Support and expect completion by March 2025. The Security+, Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, and Google IT Support course work have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, and communication skills to address problems and emerging threats. 

As of 2025, I am preparing to enroll in Western Governors University School of IT Cybersecurity and Information Assurance B.S. program.

## Objective

My journey into computer system security and system administration has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am very eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst. My goal is to continue advancing and expanding my skill set through diversified learning and relevant hands-on experience to better protect individual and organizations' privacy and data.
