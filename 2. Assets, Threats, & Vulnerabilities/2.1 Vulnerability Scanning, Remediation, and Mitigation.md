<h1>Vulnerability Scanning, Remediation, and Mitigation Project</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we dive into vulnerability essentials utilizing Microsoft Azure and Tenable. This lab is designed and set up in a secure cloud environment. With this project I practiced how to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in a secure environment as I worked to expand by knowledge, skill, and experience for my cybersecurity career.

During this lab I was able to set up a virtual machine in Azure, I configured it for vulnerability scanning and I used Tenable to perform compliance checks and scan for software vulnerabilities. Key topics include DISA STIG compliance, vulnerability remediation, and managing risks through strategies like patching and configuration changes. By the end of the lab, youâ€™ll know how to effectively reduce security risks in a real-world IT environment.
