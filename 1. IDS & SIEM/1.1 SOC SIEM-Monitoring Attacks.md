# Home-SOC-SIEM-Monitoring-Live-Attacks-

<h1>SIEM - Monitoring Live Attacks From the Web</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project we start with nothing and set up a basic home SOC in Azure. I utilize a free Azure subscription to create a virtual machine (VM), set it up as a honeypot open and accessible to the internet, and forward logs to a central repository. I then integrate Microsoft Sentinel to analyze real-world attack data.

This project covers:
    Creating an Azure subscription and setting up a VM
    Configuring Log Analytics Workspace
    Forwarding logs and integrating with Sentinel
    Querying failed login attempts and visualizing attack sources
    Building an attack map to track real-time hacker activity

This project was a great learning experience for me as a cybersecurity beginner looking to practice log analysis, threat detection, and SOC operations in a real-world cloud environment.
